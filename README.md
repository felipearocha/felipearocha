Asset Integrity Engineer working at the intersection of engineering judgment, data systems, and applied machine learning.

I build decision-support foundations for integrity and risk-based inspection programs, where data quality, traceability, and trust matter more than model complexity. My focus is not “AI for AI’s sake”, but systems that reduce manual friction and improve the quality and defensibility of engineering decisions.

I work across:
- Integrity and RBI decision logic (degradation mechanisms, inspection effectiveness, risk framing)
- Data engineering for engineering sources (drawings, inspection history, structured outputs)
- Automation that keeps assumptions explicit and failure modes visible
- Applied ML that operates within engineering constraints, not outside them

I am particularly interested in secure-by-design engineering automation, because connected environments turn data integrity into an engineering risk, not only an IT topic.

If you are working on integrity digitalization, decision support, or applied ML in industrial systems, I am always open to technical discussions and collaboration.
